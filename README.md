## The Problem

Most productivity apps optimize for volume — more tasks, more tracking, more noise. They turn your life into an endless to-do list that grows faster than you can check things off.

**Priority Compass is different.** We optimize for clarity.

This is for people who:
- Start their day overwhelmed by options
- End their day unsure what they actually accomplished
- Want to build self-awareness through structured reflection
- Need their calendar and tasks to work *together*, not in silos

## The Core Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   MORNING                    DAY                    EVENING     │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**This loop creates habit.** Morning intention → Focused execution → Evening reflection.

Most apps only handle the middle. Priority Compass completes the loop.

## What Makes This Different

### 1. **North Star: Your Life Vision**
Define your guiding vision — the person you want to become, the life you're building. This sits at the top of your dashboard, a constant reminder of your direction.
- Write your life vision
- Display prominently on dashboard
- Reference during planning and reflection

### 2. **Core Values: What Matters Most**
Identify and rank your core values. Every task can be evaluated against them.
- Define up to 5 core values
- Rank by importance
- Display on dashboard for daily alignment

### 3. **Daily Intent**
Start each day with a clear intention. What will make today a win?
- Set during morning check-in
- Review during evening reflection
- Track accomplished intents over time

### 4. **Focus Modes**
Categorize tasks by cognitive load:
- **Deep Work** — Complex, requires flow state (90+ min blocks)
- **Quick Wins** — Short, can be done in gaps (15-30 min)
- **Planning** — Strategic thinking, roadmapping (30-60 min)
- **Admin** — Routine tasks, low cognitive load (15-30 min)

Filter projects and tasks by focus mode to match your energy.

### 5. **Weekly Rhythm**
Plan your week around your natural energy patterns:
- Define energy levels for each time block (Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening)
- Set preferred focus modes per time block
- Get suggestions based on your rhythm
- See your weekly overview on the dashboard

### 6. **Intentional Check-ins**
Not just "what do I need to do?" — but "what matters most right now?"
- Time-aware prompts (morning, midday, evening)
- Energy tracking to find your patterns
- Quick recalibration when priorities shift

### 7. **Priority Tiers, Not Just Lists**
- **Hot** — Urgent, do it now
- **Warm** — Important, do it soon  
- **Cool** — Can wait a bit
- **Cold** — Backlog / someday

Tasks get routed to appropriate time slots based on priority. Hot tasks get prime morning hours. Cold tasks fill gaps.

### 8. **Smart Auto-Scheduling**
The scheduling algorithm doesn't just fill time. It considers:
- **Deadline urgency** (40%) — When is it due? How critical?
- **Time of day** (25%) — Energy-based slot selection (9-11 AM peak, 4 PM second peak)
- **Priority match** (20%) — Hot tasks get premium slots
- **Fragmentation prevention** (15%) — Avoids awkward gaps

One-click "Plan My Day" takes your auto-mode tasks and schedules them intelligently.

### 9. **Structured Reflection**
Daily, weekly, and monthly prompts guide self-awareness:
- Daily: Accomplishments, gratitude, improvements, tomorrow's intention, accomplished daily intent?
- Weekly: Wins, blockers, WarMap progress, next week focus
- Monthly: Vision check, areas to improve, goals

Streaks gamify consistency without being gimmicky.

### 10. **WarMap: Year-Level Planning**
Define annual themes and goals. Link tasks to them. Review progress during weekly reflections.

This is the missing layer between "today's tasks" and "life goals."

### 11. **Google Calendar Integration**
Two-way sync:
- See your calendar events as busy blocks
- Scheduled tasks automatically sync to Google Calendar
- Changes flow both ways

### 12. **Spotify Integration**
Attach songs to journal entries. Build a soundtrack for your productivity. Optional but surprisingly sticky.
