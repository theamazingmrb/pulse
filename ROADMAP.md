# Priority Compass Roadmap

## Vision

Priority Compass is a **personal productivity OS** for intentional people. The core thesis: clarity drives productivity, not volume. We optimize for focus and self-awareness, not task count.

**The moat**: The complete loop. Morning intention → Focused execution (with Focus Timer) → Evening reflection → Weekly/monthly patterns → Year-level goals (WarMap). No other app connects these layers.

---

## Strategic Analysis

### What's Built (Strong Foundation)

✅ **Core Loop:**
- Dashboard with daily priority display
- Check-ins (time-aware, energy tracking)
- Tasks with 4-tier priority system
- Journal with mood and task linking
- Reflections (daily/weekly/monthly) with streaks
- WarMap for annual planning
- Projects for task organization

✅ **Smart Scheduling:**
- Auto-scheduling algorithm with 4-factor scoring
- Deadline urgency, time-of-day energy, priority match, fragmentation prevention
- "Plan My Day" one-click scheduling
- Google Calendar two-way sync

✅ **Integrations:**
- Spotify playlist attachment to journals
- Web Playback SDK for in-app listening
- Google Calendar busy-block awareness

✅ **Daily Habit Anchors (Phase 1 Complete):**
- **Focus Timer / Pomodoro** — Presets (15/25/45/60 min), task linking, Spotify integration, session logging
- **Quick Add (Cmd+K)** — Global keyboard shortcut for fast task capture
- **Push Notifications** — Web push with preferences, opt-in flow

✅ **Technical Foundation:**
- Next.js 16, TypeScript, Supabase
- 11 tables with RLS (plus focus_sessions)
- Production-ready on Vercel

---

### What's Missing (The Gaps)

#### 1. **Recurring Tasks Are Still Manual** (HIGH - Phase 2 Priority)

Daily standups, weekly reviews, monthly reports — users recreate these constantly. This is friction that kills consistency.

**Solution: Recurring Tasks**

Set once, auto-create forever. Links to Focus Timer for recurring focus sessions (e.g., "Daily deep work block").

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces repetitive admin work
- Creates natural check-in points (daily review task → check-in)
- Pairs perfectly with Focus Timer (recurring focus sessions)
- Increases perceived value (set it once, benefit forever)

#### 2. **No Data Story Yet** (HIGH - Phase 2 Priority)

Users now accumulate focus session data, but see no synthesis. "I've done 50 focus sessions — so what?"

**Solution: Focus Analytics Dashboard**

This is the **next hook** after Focus Timer. It creates a feedback loop:
- Focus Timer → Sessions logged → Analytics show patterns → User adjusts behavior
- The "quantified self" appeal — users want to see their productivity data
- Gamification potential: streaks, milestones, trends

**Dashboard showing:**
- Focus time today/this week/this month
- Sessions completed vs. abandoned
- Best focus hours (from session timestamps)
- Task completion correlation (did focus sessions help complete tasks?)
- Energy patterns over time (from check-ins)
- Priority distribution (where is time going?)

#### 3. **Onboarding Doesn't Create Immediate Value** (MEDIUM - Phase 2)

Current onboarding explains the app but doesn't get users to the "aha" moment quickly enough.

**Solution: Onboarding V2**

1. Interactive tutorial (show, don't tell)
2. Create first task during onboarding
3. Guide through first focus session
4. Set up notifications during flow
5. Explain the complete loop

#### 4. **No Recurring Revenue Hook** (FUTURE)

Current feature set is free-tier friendly. Need a "pro" feature that justifies subscription.

**Future Solutions:**
- Advanced analytics with AI insights
- Custom focus timer presets saved
- Team/shared features
- Integrations (Notion, Linear, etc.)

#### Recurring Tasks (P0)

This is foundational for habit formation. Users shouldn't recreate daily/weekly tasks manually.

**Database:**
```sql
-- Add to tasks table
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN recurrence_type TEXT; -- 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'yearly'
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN recurrence_interval INT DEFAULT 1; -- every N days/weeks/months
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN recurrence_end_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN recurrence_weekdays INT[]; -- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] for specific days
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN parent_task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id); -- link instances to template
```

**UI:**
- Recurrence picker in task form (daily/weekly/monthly/custom)
- "Repeats" badge on recurring tasks
- Auto-create next instance when current completes
- Option to skip specific instances
- Recurring task templates view

**Integration with Focus Timer:**
- "Create recurring focus session" — daily deep work block
- Auto-start focus timer for scheduled recurring tasks (optional)

**Success Metrics:**
- 25% of active users have ≥1 recurring task within 30 days
- Recurring task completion rate > 85%
- Users with recurring tasks show higher retention

**Sections:**

1. **Focus Time Overview**
   - Today / This Week / This Month
   - Trend line (sessions over time)
   - Completion rate (started vs. completed)

2. **Productivity Patterns**
   - Best focus hours (heatmap: hours vs. sessions completed)
   - Most productive days (Mon-Sun comparison)
   - Energy correlation (from check-ins: high energy sessions vs. low energy)

3. **Task Insights**
   - Priority distribution (where is time going? Hot vs. Cold)
   - Tasks with most focus time
   - Focus sessions per completed task (correlation)

4. **Streaks & Milestones**
   - Check-in streak
   - Reflection streak
   - Focus streak (consecutive days with focus time)
   - Milestones (10 hours, 50 sessions, etc.)

5. **WarMap Progress**
   - Tasks completed toward annual goals
   - Focus time toward goal-related projects

**Implementation:**
- Recharts for visualizations
- Query aggregations (may need materialized views for performance)
- Weekly email digest option (future)

**Success Metrics:**
- Analytics page visit rate > 40% of active users per week

## Prioritization Framework

When prioritizing features, use this lens:

1. **Does it create daily habit?** ✅ Focus Timer done
2. **Does it reduce friction?** ✅ Quick Add done → Now Recurring Tasks
3. **Does it deepen engagement?** → Focus Analytics Dashboard
4. **Does it differentiate from competitors?** → Complete loop + data story

**Phase 1 (COMPLETE):** Build the hook → Focus Timer, Quick Add, Push Notifications
**Phase 2 (CURRENT):** Deepen engagement → Recurring Tasks, Analytics, Onboarding V2
**Phase 3 (FUTURE):** Growth & differentiation → AI insights, Mobile PWA, Team features

---

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Current Technical Debt
- No automated tests for scheduling algorithm
- Some components have grown large (dashboard, task list)
- Missing loading states in some areas
- Error handling could be more graceful
- Need analytics queries optimized (may need materialized views)

### Maintenance Priorities
1. Add unit tests for `lib/scheduling.ts`
2. Component audit for large files (>300 lines)
3. Loading skeleton components for all data-fetching views
4. Error boundary testing
5. Add indexes for focus_sessions queries before Analytics launch

## Open Questions

1. ~~**What's the right Focus Timer default?**~~ Answered: 25/5 Pomodoro with presets (15/25/45/60). Users can customize.
2. **Should Focus Timer block the browser?** Current: runs in background. Consider: optional "strict mode" for future.
3. **How to handle offline?** PWA? Service worker? Queue locally? — Deferred to Phase 3.
4. **What's the monetization model?** Freemium base, paid analytics? Team features paid? — Needs research.
5. **When to build mobile app?** After PWA? Or skip PWA and go native? — Recommend PWA first for cross-platform.
6. **How to visualize focus patterns?** Heatmap? Line chart? Both? — User testing needed for Analytics.

| Productivity Analytics | 🔄 (Phase 2) | ✅ (paid) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Recurring Tasks | 🔄 (Phase 2) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Complete loop** — No one else connects intention → focus → reflection → goals
2. **Energy-based scheduling** — Unique 4-factor algorithm
3. **Focus Timer built-in** — Not just tasks, but the doing
4. **WarMap for annual planning** — Most apps are day/week only

**Competitive Threats:**
- Todoist could add focus timer and energy tracking
- Notion templates could replicate the loop
- New entrants focusing on "mindful productivity"

**Defensibility:**
- Data moat: More users use it, better the scheduling algorithm gets
- Habit moat: Daily focus sessions create sticky behavior
- Integration moat: Calendar sync, Spotify, future integrations create switching cost

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 is complete.** Priority Compass now has the **daily habit anchor** (Focus Timer) that makes it essential.

**Phase 2 priorities:**
1. **Recurring Tasks** (P0) — Reduce friction, create habit loops
2. **Focus Analytics Dashboard** (P1) — The next hook. Show users their data, create the "quantified self" motivation
3. **Onboarding V2** (P2) — Drive immediate value, get users to first focus session

The key insight: **Focus Timer creates the data. Analytics makes it meaningful.** This loop — focus → see results → improve — is what creates long-term engagement.

Build Recurring Tasks and Analytics next. Measure retention. Then grow.
